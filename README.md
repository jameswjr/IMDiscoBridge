#  IMDiscoBridge ðŸ’¬âœ¨
##  iMessage â†” Discord Bridge for macOS

**IMDiscoBridge** is an experimental bridge that allows forwarding iMessages from your Mac into Discord channels, and replying to them from Discord back into iMessage. It runs entirely on your Mac, using AppleScript and local SQLite queries.

> **WARNING: This is experimental software.**  
> It manipulates local iMessage state using AppleScript and reads from system-level SQLite databases. Use with care. No data is sent to any server besides your Discord instance.
